I'll create two separate versions of the script:

Use either function independently based on your needs. Each script can be included separately:

```html
<!-- For sentence case -->
<script src="sentence-case.js"></script>
<script>
    applySentenceCase();
</script>

<!-- OR for title case -->
<script src="title-case.js"></script>
<script>
    applyTitleCase();
</script>
```
